RecordNo,HBU_Q17
2075,66 years have taught me this society cares nothing about pollution
2223,A complex but interesting topic
567,"A difficult balance between repurposing and protecting wildlife, for every site rich in wildlife that is redeveloped, another within a certain radius should be preserved. We cant develop more at the expense of wildlife"
342,A good subject
1931,A lot but I have not got the time at the moment. It really comes down to ' who owns the land?' and what is the UK Government trying to do to encourage mass housing on land which was never meant for housing.
1555,A priority should be given to housing also protect wildlife
482,Abandoned mines etc should be considered as high-risk for crime enabling
1938,Absolutely agree with putting Housing on Brownfield sites - however you still need to give these people access to some form of green space within the estate.
2084,Adding public rights of way whether the site is developed or not is a priority
531,"Affordable housing for everyone, including plentiful access to green spaces"
769,Affordable housing is necessary but not at detriment to environment and natural wildlife . We need to look after our planet
2181,"After effective attempts to clean them up as much as possible, they should be left to slowly recover. This might take a good few centuries."
578,All brownfield sites should be prkoritised for affordable housing but must have sensible sized gardens and or green open space
1565,All brownfield sites should be reused for housing as the country has a massive homeless population that need cheap homes to rent not multimillion pounds houses
1467,All Brownfield sites should be used first.
1483,All Brownfield sites should be used instead of Green sites
602,All building housing or industrial should use brownfield sites first
1288,All for wildlife
1486,"All land should be used in some positive way, but people really undervalue walking and areas that can be used for enjoyment whilst helping the wildlife"
70,"All natural sites should be able to add value to local communities, opening up access and allowing people to spend time outside and in nature."
645,all should be designated for nature.
2206,"ALL sites around here are considered/used for building, particularly greenfield sites as they don’t need clearing. Houses are built everywhere/anywhere with no thought of infrastructure. We pay 3 times the Council tax of Westminster, yet the roads are covered in litter and potholes, rubbish collection/ bin emptying is seldom done, shop rents are so dear the town centre is empty. The business park by us sits empty still. The schools are in a desperate state of disrepair."
1165,all sites in uk are in different areas so all need to be assessed induvidually
718,ALL SITES should be considered for housing BEFORE using greenfield
1145,All these sites need to be used for the community’s living in said area
1137,Almost everywhere in England was previously a brownfield site
633,Although I like the Idea of a wild life and plant area we have a bigger need for housing so in reality that probably what I would say is needed
2199,"Although we need more housing especially low cost housing , we also need to be mindful of wildlife and green areas . Renewable energy sources are very much needed and we need more environmentally friendly fuel sources such as wind / solar power ."
1158,"always seems a shame that developers demolish existing building to build for profit, without concerns for environmental effect of the projects"
1515,"Answers very much depend on where you live. I live close to Dartmoor so, frankly, have no real feelings about brownfield sites. If I lived in a big city, I would probably give somewhat different answers."
651,Any changes to a community should be considered carefully and the views of those it will affect the most.
631,Any site that can be used for sustainability purpose would be most benefícial
1222,Apart from being tedious I don't think one can make informed decisions after looking at a photograph
941,appalling survery re response boxes. tedious and difficult to use. your results will be unreliable i fear
1193,"Area needs to be risk assess for flooding, land movements, sink holes etc before being developed"
1060,Areas for wild life should be given priority
1405,"As a former resident of Kent and a housing manager I was always aware of the derelict /brown field sites around South and East Kent . Kent is littered with such areas needing redevelopment .However my home village was punched through with a cross channel High speed rail link, a motorway and the tthreat of a massive housing project plus a bio fuel digester (180 lorries a day projected to bring in waste .)all built in the surrounding countryside . Ashford,7 miles away, was turned into an outsiders rental paradise -cheap slab flats with lots of landlords minting it from asylum seekers and benefit dependents .We packed our bags and moved ."
1150,"as a village,we have all sorts of sites around us,like the catergories previously mentioned,but there is room,so as long as they are far enough away from the village housing,there is no problem"
2098,As long as it was managed to the best of ability
180,As long as it’s for the good of the land and or critters / wildlife is a good thing.
702,As many sites as possible should remain undeveloped (whether brownfield sites or not) as there is plenty of developed or disused land that can be repurposed and redeveloped.
565,As much land as possible should be left undeveloped to allow wildlife to flourish.
2110,As previously mentioned. Each and every site has its own merits. Therefore future uses had their own pros and cons
710,"As previously ststed, brownfield sites are complex and each one is different. Trying to standardise them is a lost cause. It is a highly specialised field and tightly controlled by law."
570,"Authorities need to be more aware of things like floodplains, fragile eco-systems, affects on the environment (e.g. trees do a lot more than provide wood and shade)."
1136,Be good to use them as renewable energy sources. Instead of putting up housing estates. More need to be put in to renewable energy
2214,Be nice to clean some up and make the recreational
1680,"Before we develop areas of green belt land, councils should ensure that all brownfield sites have been used"
2086,Better to improve brownfield sites than use farming land.
1539,Better to use them than dig up farmland. I do not agree with wind farms. They are bird choppers in all circumstances. Use other power production methods first.
16,better used for something than nothing
1615,brown field need to be managed to their potential
2019,Brown field site help slow development of green field sites
111,Brown field sites in towns should be developed but not in the countryside
2030,brown field sites should be used before using green field sites to build on
1840,Brown field sites with no discernable eco credentials should be used for building affordable social housing to rent.
1889,Brown sites should be clean if hazardous to any life and put the best use in that area.
1989,Brownfield and undeveloped sites are being developed before greenfield sites. Brownfield and undeveloped sites should all be developed before building on greenfield sites is allowed.
1779,Brownfield developed before undeveloped.
713,"Brownfield development should be first choice over Greenfield sites. Will fe should be protected, encouraged, accommodated in all developments."
2143,Brownfield for housing every time as opposed to green belt.
1863,Brownfield land dependent on size should be considered for both housing and managed wildlife reserve
799,brownfield or undeveloped sites should always be used before considering green belt removal
1419,Brownfield should be only built on if it is beneficial to the community and as a.last resort. It should.not be built on at the expense of green belt
1331,Brownfield should be turned into nature reserves.
1883,Brownfield site like quarries snd mines or extraction can be excellent wildlife sites - if it’s not suitable for that then priority should go to housing.
942,"Brownfield sites - what is really important is WHAT WAS THERE before - when was it there active as a usiness or whatever -what is in the ground, soaked down?"
2032,"Brownfield sites and refurbished sites should be used for solar and wind energy first , green field sites for housing last , redevelop offices for housing Stop building on farm land!!!."
1717,"Brownfield sites are better if housing must be built, than on greenbelt."
1140,Brownfield sites are cool
1224,"Brownfield sites are not always best, an assessment of the local wildlife and potential impacts should be done before any development"
1856,"Brownfield sites are often extraordinarily rich in wildlife . I didn’t feel the questions were helpful - they made assumptions which aren’t necessarily true so we’re impossible to answer . For instance, the surrounds of industrial sites being relatively undisturbed can be great for wildlife yet agricultural use sounds good but can be a chemical polluted monoculture"
329,Brownfield sites are often overdeveloped to hit impossible housing targets
1765,Brownfield sites are often overly generalised and the vagueness does not highlight that some are rich in wildlife
1251,Brownfield sites are there to be used.
1302,"Brownfield sites can be a eyesore and not a safe place. Turn them into something useful, housing and factories"
1921,Brownfield sites can be a good thing if they provide value locally.
2060,Brownfield sites have to be detoxified before use for housing to prevent harm to the population.
35,Brownfield sites in cities and towns should be used before ones in more open areas where there is rich wildlife already there. If they are developed then spaces for wildlife and biodiversity as well as public access should e built in as standard.
746,"Brownfield sites in or close to towns should be used for housing, with a nature reserve attached. NOT INDUSTRIAL."
1553,Brownfield sites in the countryside should be prioritised for nature. Brownfield sites in urban areas should be used for housing or industry. Green belts should be sacrasanct.
700,Brownfield sites must always be used for development before greenfield sites.
1662,Brownfield sites near urban areas need to be prioritised for use with wildlife
996,Brownfield sites need community input for redevelopment
1527,Brownfield sites rich in animal life should be left undeveloped.
1076,Brownfield sites ripe for redevelopment should have a time limit placed on them to avoid land being left purposely undeveloped.
248,brownfield sites should always be developed for housing rather than using green belt land
2243,Brownfield sites should always be given preference over other undeveloped areas when planning.
323,Brownfield sites should always be selected for housing and Greenfield sites left alone
2144,Brownfield sites should always be the preference for development over other land.
896,Brownfield sites should always be used for housing before any greenfield sites
228,"Brownfield sites should always be used for industrial, commercial or housing use before ""green"" land, I remember when I was a child a lovely wood being ripped apart to build office space, much of which has been at some stage lain empty."
221,Brownfield sites should be appropriately used in its surroundings for example in the middle of an urban area use for housing. In rural areas energy production or wide life use
151,"Brownfield sites should be developed ahead of other available land, regardless of the nature of repurpose."
1929,"Brownfield sites should be developed, so that Greenbelt land is not developed"
1124,Brownfield sites should be exhausted before building on greenfield sites
1042,"Brownfield sites should be prioritised for redevelopment by distance from city centres, nearer to the centre first."
1556,Brownfield sites should be re used in some form.
1433,Brownfield sites should be the first to be redeveloped rather than building on green belt land which should be protected at all costs
1849,Brownfield sites should be used and not left to pollute the environment. Undeveloped sites need to be evaluated so that they are used to enhance the lives of the local population.
1481,brownfield sites should be used before greenfield sites where possible
379,Brownfield sites should be used first where there is no important biodiversity at risk
1454,Brownfield sites should be used for development where suitable before greenfield sites
764,Brownfield sites should be used for housing and manufacturing sites before using more undeveloped and green belt sites.
1279,Brownfield sites should be used for housing before green field or greenbelt sites
1504,Brownfield sites should be used for the benefit of the environment and community rather than for priority finicial gain.
1352,brownfield sites should be used for the local community outside sports field and nature reserves
204,brownfield sites should be used for useful purposes rather than encroaching on green belt/gardens/coastline
1155,"Brownfield sites should be used sensitively with awareness of wildlife, flora and fauna. Research should be carefully undertaken before using such sites, particularly with regard to old mining works which often underlie housing in some parts."
1188,Brownfield sites should have a clause in their ownership that if they aren't developed in 5 years the council can take over for free and put housing n them
884,Brownfield sites should not be lost to housing.
950,brownfield sites should not be neglected must be put to use
266,Brownfield sites should really be properly documented and managed.
2039,Brownfield sites should still always be promoted as first choice for redevelopment over virgin ground
1410,Brownfield sites sound like a good idea only if redeveloped.
1591,"Brownfield sites which are not under any current development plans need to be categorised e.g. for future development, retention as open space, leisure activity etc. Those for development can then be highlighted for companies to consider. Brownfield sites should, in most situations, be used before greenfield sites, unless the brownfield site has had time to become an important wildlife area and of value to the local population, compared to a monoculture type landscape."
681,"Brownfield sites which revert to fields are different from abandoned sites in cities, why didn't you state the areas you were interested in were rural area."
914,"Brownfield sites, including derelict buildings in urban areas, should be redeveloped as a matter of urgency."
1412,"Brownfield sites, with little nature, should be a priority for building"
690,Brownfield use should always prioritise the erosion of green belts
1181,Build houses.
1468,"Build less houses, bring in less people we are crippled by the amount of people we have. Less people so we can manage what we have and keep it. Be green, not carbon using. Renewable energy yes, but less people."
1825,"Build more houses. Homes, not chicken coops."
930,Build more housing seeing as it was the evil Pro EU lot that signed us up to Free Movement. Either deport the foreigners or build more houses for us.
1492,Build on brownfield and leave the rest alone
630,Cafes
1594,Can be a great asset to the community if managed well
2210,Central Government should ensure local councils are adequately funded to make most of these brownfield sites to the benefit of the environment & local community.
1376,Certainly better to develop brown rather than greenfield sights.
1941,Changes to land use should be properly assessed and an emphasis should be placed on the protection of environmental and heritage assets before the expansion of housing or built environment
734,"City centres will become the new brown field sites - office blocks could be repurposed as housing and empty retail buildings / sites could become work hubs with access to tech resources / meeting spaces etc. Other retail space would make great gallery and workshop space for artists, designer etc."
68,Climate change should be a huge consideration
87,"Completely depends on the circumstances, I.e. location, previous use, local needs, adjacent uses, potential development value and potential alternative value."
1623,Concern about hidden contamination
314,Concerned about pollution and health issues linked to building on previously developed land
1100,"Conserving nature should be a priority when deciding what to do with these brownfield sites, whether developed or undeveloped"
1592,Contaminated land should be decontaminated or left undeveloped
550,Council’s always build houses on sites which could be used for much more
1122,Councils seem to take little notice of the public as they have government targets to meet for development.
1426,"Councils should consider brownfield sites for development but only if there's no huge impact on wildlife, particularly rare species."
561,Current government have no interest in our opinion
300,Dependent on local housing shortage
1114,"depends on size and location, what the slope and general relief of the land, how accessible it is, how flooded it gets ... what the previous landuse was, ie toxic soils ... how much open land is currently available to the local population and whether it gets used at the moment by local people for a variety of activities .. ball games, running, cycling, picnics, a green break from other housing forming a natural border between communities who value the open land whether brownfield or not ... whether it is a dangerous and huge building or mill, ex steel works place, or an open space are that was a factory now demolished, or an old aerodrome from the war ... geography of course ... which you have totally ignored in this useless exercise of make believe land"
1330,Depends on what it was used for before!1
1037,Depends on what the brownfield site was previously used for.
195,Depends on what the land was used for before. Depends on local needs.
340,Depends upon surrounding sites
1175,Depends. If it’s fields etc then natural reserve or renewable energy. If buildings still standing heritage based housing or industry
1865,Designate to improve the environment
462,"Developers must be made to develop brownfield sites before greenfield. This should be done by punitive extra financial constraints on the development of greenfield sites. Government legislation, planning laws and local authorities should be much more insistent on the use of brownfield sites instead of the easier options."
1943,"Developers who land-bank should be forced to sell their land for housing, at the same price for which it was originally purchased. The green belt and all green undeveloped land should be protected from development. Empty homes should be reclaimed."
931,"development shoukd be discussed wuth the local community. And if housing must be built, roads, schools, doctors etc MUST be dealt with first"
1690,"development should be a level playing field, not at the whim of office wallahs."
1450,"Development should be focussed in urban areas, undeveloped greenfield land should be the focus of agricultural uses, some renewable energy projects, and nature conservation and restoration. I know in reality this is not practical but should be a general rule."
2080,did not know enough about sites
906,Didn’t realise they were so varied
2170,Difficult to make decisions when no knowledge of other external factirs
1827,"Difficult topic based on multiple factors, wildlife/housing/renewable energy. The land in question and local area would need to be the driving factor."
2016,Disused and empty buildings should be redeveloped for new housing and other projects NOT allowing the disgusting ruin 9f previously undeveloped land.
538,Disused land does not necessarily increase crime or anti-socual behaviour. It is happening elsewhere anyway.
2127,Do not developers cut corners to save money if they have these sites to develop.
1627,Doesn't impact my life in any shape or form.
1777,"dogs should be banned from nature reserves. In Surrey, marauding pet dogs are destroying habitat for ground nesting birds and scaring off other forms of wildlife."
1422,Don't build on them. Nature needs to thrive somewhere
174,Don't keep building houses on various brownfield sites!
2052,"Don't turn them into vape shops, barbers, nail salons, phone repair shops, or fast food joints."
1047,don't use our greenfield
380,Each site and location is unique and so I cannot offer a general opinion.
800,"Each site is different so it is imossible to generalise, but if a site is attracting anti-social behaviour or criminal activity, such as fly tipping, then I believe it should be developed as soon as a suitable use can be found."
1734,"Each site needs to be considered on its own merits as to what should be done, that's why we have planning policy and local plans"
736,Each site should be assessed on the merits for the purpose that suits that enviormnment
245,Every brownfield site can only be individually assessed as each is different.
1624,Every opportunity to support wildlife should be key
1266,Everything should consider climate change and preserving nature.
2190,Everything would depend on why the land became a brownfield site and what was previously there.
880,"Ex industrial sites, not contaminated are best for housing"
1799,Ex landfill land should not be used for housing. We know enough about plastic decomposition to know this would be a bad idea. Those questions were also really boring
2101,"Far to many housing estates being built in local areas that local people cannot afford ,meaning people from other areas ie London are buying them and renting them out."
1598,far to much development taking place against the wishes of local residents
358,Far too many houses being built on any available land in our so-called village.
1296,Far too much 'undeveloped' land is being squandered for building at the moment instead of using brownfield for that purpose
285,Fields for food
1570,Flexible infill housing for multigenerational housing should be made easier.
1803,Focus needs to be on brownfield sites and making best use of current housing.
1800,"For these questions I cannot see how I can give a meaningful answer as I don't have enough information to do so. For the following question, we would like you to imagine a brownfield site that's currently unmanaged, with no public access and is currently available for repurposing... On a scale of 1 to 8, where '1' is 'Most preferred' and '8' is 'Least preferred', please rate what you think personally a brownfield site, with little value to wildlife should be used for? (Please select a different number from 1 to 8 on each row)"
312,Former industrial sites should be reclaimed and used for housing.
190,Funding should be made available for more development on undeveloped sites and quality land preserved for parks and reserves. There is too much poor quality ‘green space’
315,Generally I believe brownfield sites are not sufficiently utilised prior to using green field sites.
162,Get houses built on them for the country
305,"Give as many as possible back to nature, plants, trees and flowers enhance our well-being and encourage wildlife."
804,Good
1086,Good
447,Good places to walk the dog
1802,Government and councils should be looking to overhaul and improve the housing stock we already have before they should be allowed to build ANY new housing. There are millions of houses laying derelict and empty that could and should be brought back into the housing stock. It is councils’ duty to make the best use of our existing housing stock and derelict office spaces and other buildings too. Making them fit places for occupation.
706,Government support should be available to clean up brown field sites
1334,"Government target of 300,000 houses per year is incorrect and unwarranted. See Ian Mulheirns blogs"
398,Great
786,Great for nature
627,Greater priority should be given to using brownfield sites for housing or industrial development before building on greenfield sites.
453,Green belt should be preserved.
21,"Green eneregy and homes are important to me, but so is biodiversity. Monocrop agriculture is not so good for biodiversity"
1079,Green energy should be our priority
367,Green space and nature reserves are so important for mental health purposes. We are losing far too many.
1064,"Green spaces are needed for mental health and wellbeing, and for nature."
990,Happy with status quo
222,Hate it when people think that greenbelt is actually brownfield
1637,have found it thought proviking and interesting
91,Help the wildlife.
755,Help to keep the green belt
1926,hopefully these sites will be redeveloped
67,House building must include building of public amenities
678,House prices are far too high for first time buyers - building new developments has to be a priority is net migration is to stay high. Hopefully this can be managed in a non environmentally destructive way...?
1414,"Houseing is good, prices need to be reduced. Clean Energy production is good for our needs"
860,"Houses have to be built somewhere, and house building is profitable, therefore brownfield sites should normally be the first choice."
1961,"Houses need time be built, preferably not on flood plains and not on sites where much wildlife is found"
306,Houses should stop being built on green field sites on the edges of town. Just make congestion worse and contributes to urban sprawl
1232,"housing and bidiversity should be encouraged, however all sites should be productive and developed for the benefit off the local community"
307,"Housing is a much larger priority on Brown field sites, there is also large demand for commercial multi-purpose units in most towns with the growth of ecommerce. Other uses I would support are re-purposing for Farmland (the UK has a need to 'grow its own' and become more self sufficient since leaving the EU and to repurpose these sites for genuine long term Green industries."
63,"housing is a real problem, but more importantly affordable housing and a rent cap. It is a disgrace that private landlords can hold such a monopoly."
8,Housing is good
1801,"Housing is my least preferred option in all cases, losing the land forever. The other options would keep land available to be used in the future and to leave open spaces for wildlife, fauna and flora and most of all for use by people"
2172,"Housing is needed for young people, and a lot more of it should be affordable, so this should be the priority for suitable brown field sites."
2042,Housing is preferred to wind farms or solar farms
1643,Housing needs to be very sympathetic to the surrounding areas
2103,Housing should always be built on brownfield sites rather than previously undeveloped land
936,Housing should be built on all sites. I hate the countryside.
910,Housing should be prioritised but not at the expense of wildlife
1420,"Housing to me is most important, unless the land is rich in wildlife in which case it should be used for conservation."
572,How about not destroying nature and local habitats at all and the local landscape at all unless there's a good reason to do so from the local perspective. And I don't mean importing a bunch of foreigners to change the local perspective either.
200,I agree that brownfield sites should be used for housing development since it is hugely more appropriate than using greenfield or prime agricultural land - which is what developers prefer as it costs less to prepare and is usually in a more attractive situation for higher cost housing.
866,I agree they should be used over greenfield sites but torfaen council are avoiding this and constantly using greenfield sites.
1906,"I always ranked housing as low as I believe there is enough housing space and facilities if only they were managed better and less for profit. And other industrial facilities should never come at the expense of nature. I tried to rank the renewable resources based on the amount of impact they'd have on the wildlife and ecology already on the site. We have a finite amount of space, and I think we should preserve biodiversity undeveloped land, and in places where brownfield sites have recovered nature in many forms these too should be preserved and cared for l, instead of development for profits sake and not need."
2160,"I am a supporter of developing brownfield sites in city centres, but the images tended to indicate more rural locations which I would be less supportive to see turned into housing or an industrial estate"
674,I am all for greening the country and making us live sustainably and environmentally conscious.
1783,"I am aware that there is a lack of housing in this country so agree that some of these sites may be good for developing, but I do think that it is very important to consider any wildlife that may be inhabiting the site."
1851,"I am concerned that land is being over-developed, causing damage to the water table and destroying natural habitats."
178,"I am most concerned about the ruining of land. We have too many people, not too little housings. I am concerned about our longer term problems if we keep building on farmland. Where will our food be grown? I also have great concerns about ruining land that is currently ""wild"" - we are killing wildlife in great numbers, & I find that appalling."
381,I am very much in favour of using brown field sites within cities as space for housing
697,"I appreciate the need for housing but new build estates that are thrown up quickly and cheaply without much thought to the local area and its present inhabitants are so unappealing, I would much rather land remains available for wildlife or used for productive renewable energy use"
417,"I appreciate we need more housing but I think we need more trees too, there was no suggestion of purely trees going on it...."
1038,I believe it is important to take into context the wildlife and plant life of the local area surrounding the brownfield site rather than classing them as always fit to be developed.
377,I believe they should be put to good use
414,I consider the image of the rape seed to be pollition as the pesticides used are terrible for biodiversty and human health.
1660,I could not put the correct answers in as the the system was not set up properly
28,"I do not believe tht undeveloped land should be used for housing or industrial use. I am happier (alhough not entirely happy) about using brownfield sites for housing, indutrial or solar farm use."
753,I do not know much about this subject so I have based my responses on personal preferences
498,I do not think any greenfield sites should be used for industrial purposes or housing. Our green spaces are important for our physical and mental well-being also to encourage biodiversity and should be preserved as such.
207,I do not think the green belt should be built one. I think public footpaths should be preserved. Above all wildlife should be catered for
856,I don’t know enough about this topic to offer an educated response
904,I don’t know much about them
1258,I don't feel that I know enough about the effects of bio fuel crops and digesters on wildlife to make a proper ranking
1373,I don't know much about brownfield sites but I would prefer the use of any unused land to be for the benefit of wildlife where possible
1045,I dont know much about it all
1593,"I don't like anything changed that will damage wildlife. I also don't like push towards biofuel because even that will cause some pollution (i.e., manufacture)"
1599,I don't like the idea of tgem
1579,I don't mind them being redeveloped but should be done sensitively
1798,I don't really care about it
1557,I don't really like them
32,I dont think housing should be the automatic choice for brownfield sites.
308,I don't think undeveloped sites rich in wildlife should be used for anything until all brownfield sites are repurposed.
1089,I feel fascinated by brownfield sites / undeveloped sites. They are really interesting to explore.
1323,I feel in the UK we are lacking free to use public spaces. I am strongly in favour of green energy encouraging biodiversity and making more areas available for public use. Well I'm not against new build housing to feel the quality of new build housing is normally poor and there are not adequate amenities provided on most new build sites.
1608,I feel more places should be left for wildlife.There are so many houses going up that there is almost nowhere left for wild life to go!!
831,"I feel that the questions and photos were cherry picked to give a desired outcome in the questions , I.e. not unbiased. most brownfield sites are not good and need redevelopment as housing rather than green field site. a few brown fields may meet the criteria of this survey."
471,"I feel that we need to remember that we are a highly populated, small island and a vast amount of our agricultural land, used to produce food, is disappearing underneath concrete and buildings."
375,"I found the photos unhelpful - the edge of a chalk ridge/old quarry for example doesn't really crop up in the middle of a major metropolitan area. And further into the questionnaire, decisions on how land should be used depends on its location."
1441,"I have been involved in discussions regarding what land she be utilised for and found that local government tend to do as they wish, whether it be right or wrong."
2156,I have little opinion on this topic.
525,"I have much to say on this topic, but for specifically Scotland and not the UK/England."
2148,I have no I interest at all in brownfield sites
191,I know I wouldn't want to live on a former brownfield site as would be worried about long term pollution in ground
1760,I know more about brownfield sites now after taking this survey and feel more positive about them
795,I know we need houses but we have to encourage wild life. We have to think of the future for all things.
658,"I like the idea of this land being rewilded or turned back into a public commons eg. Parks, nature reserves. Unfortunately, there is no profit motive to converting old land for these purposes, so it’s almost always turned into homes or shops. Wouldn’t be so bad if the homes weren’t so expensive and poor quality. I think there should be a legal requirement to convert a minimum amount of brownfields land into public commons."
1494,I live directly opposite a water foul wildlife reserve looking much like the images shown. It has never been misused or soiled or dumped on. Why allow any change to the beauty.
1342,i live in a rural area and i always find it interesting how certain developers easily gain planning permission for housing on greenfield sites.
116,I live in an area with many brownfield sites that have been turned into nature reserves and country parks. They are wonderful places and heavily used by the local communities.
2189,I live in london the last greenfield site I was aware of was the Greenwich peninsular they built the Millenium dome on it
641,I love to see brownfield sites to stay either unchanged or used as a nature reserve.
744,"I misunderstood the extent of Brownfield site, prior to answering the questions."
350,I need to learn 1st about brownfield
2168,I perceive brownfield sites as previous used sites within an urban area. The sites shown in the survey appear to be on the whole wild sites with public access. I resent the fact that sites like this have been in this way to elicit a response which would endorse a redevelopment that I would not approve of
1988,I personally don't think we need any more housing as the birth rate is going down dramatically and we have enough houses for everyone. Many Europeans are going back home and that's good as we are only a small island and we were getting so full so with the falling birth rate and falling immigration we should have enough for everyone. Maybe just build some bigger houses with granny annexes to cater for the multi generation living which now seems to be coming back into fashion and granny could stay in her house surrounded by family who will look in on her.
271,I personally would love the opportunity to self-build on a brownfield site and help regeneration.
1186,I really don't know enough about brownfield sites to have an opinion
535,"I really think it impossible to say what is the best use of any brownfield site without more information. If it was a landfill site or a or on a flood plain it would be unsuitable for housing anyway. Where possible wildlife should be encouraged and renewable energy areas could be put on areas unsuitable for housing. If there is no danger of flooding or toxic leaks then maybe housing should be prefered but by that I mean 'affordable' housing, not sold off to large building companies to build expensive very profitable (for them) types of housing."
649,"I recognise that some brown filed sites. located in areas where open land is scarce may be good as wild life reserves ie old quarries, tips like the piles of china clay waste or old golf courses but those in towm should be used fro hosing before fields are built on"
2043,I support this
507,"I support use of brownfield sites for housing, if developed sympathetically"
2037,I think a lot of existing housing stock should be updated/improved to address housing issues. There is a demand for housing though and it has to be built somewhere but nobody likes it being built near them. The same goes for wind/solar farms. Wind turbines in particular get an unfair reputation and I think the government should address this and push wind power as it is such a great way of harnessing energy for the UK in a sustainable way. I guess there is interest in preserving the status quo for the existing energy cartel and the government though!
411,I think all brownfields sites should be re-purposed for use as there are too many green field sites being taken over for some form of conversion.
721,I think all new developments (housing or commercial) should use up available brownfield sites first before building on greenfield sites
264,I think any waste land should be made use of and more affordable housing should be built along with doctors and schools
1015,I think both sites are beneficial as long as they have access / paths etc. They either provide good space for wildlife and dog walkers or open spaces for kids to play in
703,"I think brownfield sites can be rich in wildlife and be of great value, but it massively depends! Thanks for the interesting survey."
1269,I think brownfield sites should be developed but should take into account the needs of the local area including environmental issues and housing needs.
995,"I think brownfield sites should be put to some use, but can see why that might be difficult to decide. All for wildlife being encouraged!"
325,I think brownfield sites should be redeveloped before undeveloped sites.
261,I think England should have more right to roam
878,"I think housing should be more on inner city brownfield sites and using existing buildings (empty, for example)."
1108,"I think if the site at least appears to be managed or under surveillance there is less chance of it being used for anti-social behaviours. If it is providing goodness for nature than it is best to continue to nurture the space in that direction and give back the most value to the community and eco-system as a whole. If it is not rich in wildlife resources, then it seems more permissable to use it for more industrial purposes or housing."
2102,I think it is preferable to build new housing on brownfield sites rather than in green belts. I believe planning permission should not be granted in a green belt zone when brownfield sites could be used as an alternative.
979,I think it is very important to look at wildlife issues first before making these decisions
224,I think it would be great to make use of these areas should be developed in some way it would improve the areas and cut down crime
1306,"I think it would depend on very many factors including the need for housing in a particular area and the particular characteristics of the sites in question, eg whether there were protected, endangered or rare species on a site. It would also depend on its location, eg for wind or solar power."
671,I think it's an undesirable situation that land can be bought with the express intent of not building on it immediately in favour of waiting until the land has become a more valuable commodity on which to build. This is capitalism working against the interests of society for the purpose of profit.
1177,I think land shouldn’t be left alone abonded I think it should be developed and residents should have a say in how it is developed
81,I think local people's views should be listened to when considering development of sites near their homes
1731,i think maybe sometimes they should be left to nature so people have a bit of wildlife to visit especially if they life in a city
547,I think more brownfield sites should be developed into something useful.
840,I think more of it should be used
2076,"I think more should be done to ensure current housing options are safe (ie cladding in tower blocks) clean and affordable, well regulated to protect renters and home owners rather than landlords, before we build on reclaimed, brownfield or undeveloped sites."
1195,I think only sites that don’t contain any pollution should be used for housing
1519,"I think people who own more than one property which is left uninhabited should have it compulsory purchased by the government and then used for housing. I very strongly disagree with people owning holiday homes and then many new builds are built. In my opinion there is not such a massive shortage of housing as there are many houses used for short periods of time eg housing, they could be used/sold to accommodate people for homes rather than keep building houses and taking up good land that should be left for wildlife. I very strongly feel that new house estates should have a good number of trees planted too by the developer but not at the cost to the buyers. We recently moved to a new housing estate (which we very much regret but circumstances happened) we have identified that there are so very few trees, shrubs and greenery that it is quite depressing plus there is very little wildlife. In 11 months we have only seen a few pigeons and doves as there is no where for birds to go. I very"
2126,"I think sites that are rich in wildlife, especially rare and protected species, should be left as unmanaged as possible. Otherwise, managed nature reserves make great features for local communities, improve mental and physical health of local residents."
2015,I think that brownfield sites should be used to help local wildlife and flowers.
1933,"I think that green field sites should be protected, more than currently. There used to be a green field site very close to my home but now it's a big housing estate."
1642,"I think that if they are developed for housing or industrial purposes there should be strict 'green' clauses attached requiring energy efficiency, use of sustainable materials, contribution to/creation of green areas in the locality etc."
1566,I think that nature should be a priority and sustainable energy
1797,I think that the development of brownfield sites for housing is better than using useful agricultural land. In all cases it depends on location and what impact any development would have on the local community. Overlarge developments dumped in the countryside can totally unbalance existing villages or small towns.
1389,I think that the green belts around the uk should be sustained irrespective of whether the land is fallow and not used . Brownfield sites I have learned are not always derelict buildings ! ...
100,"I think that the land needs to be used in some way as it serves no purpose when left and although renewable energy and housing is extremely important, green space and wildlife should also be incorporated into it"
1928,I think that there should be no housing built on green areas until brownfield sites are utilised.
1874,I think that they should be developed before greenbelt sites.
500,"I think that where you mention the Government in the introduction, you probably mean for England and possibly Wales, yes? In which case, please specify that. The desirability of development of brownfield and undeveloped sites depends on their location - in a city centre which already has wildlife, or a city centre which lacks green spaces, or the edge of town by the sea, or the edge of town by more green space. Each individual case should be considered on its merits, which a bias towards nature preservation, because it is easy to destroy natural sites but hard and sometimes impossible to restore them."
1864,"I think the Government should do more/support and encourage more development of eco friendly projects and develop more natural/wildlife areas rather than using ""open space"" for more housing. There enough empty residential and commercial buildings that could be used for that purpose."
997,"I think there needs to be a careful balance between meeting the needs of human populations with affordable & adequate housing /education/ facilities/ transport networks, including decent public transport, & leaving undeveloped spaces as they are. The world needs areas where the biodiversity is undisturbed, to help off-set some of the destruction we create. Humans also need places to go where they can be part of nature, & learn to respect & value nature, for the good of their health & well-being. This might be in managed ex-brownfield sites, as much as in countryside areas."
1741,"I think there needs to be more land left as land, for people to walk on in a safe way."
296,I think there should be more land used for parks and outdoor activities
1183,"i think there should be tighter planning laws as many sites are built on and then they add extras after wards which break the law but go un punished, the punishement for breaking it needs to remove ANY profit the law breaker has made or was to make buy breaking the law"
1425,I think there where there is no impact on local wildlife then it should be made easier for the land to be developed. I also think those developers who buy it with intention of not building but increasing the land value there should be a use it or lose it law passed
862,I think there will be lots of companies using these sites to build housing (esp. in London) which is not good for wildlife & the environment
743,I think they should be managed as green belt land or a nature reserve.
2125,I think using brownfield sites is much better as it leaves more natural areas
607,"I think we must take care to protect wildlife first and foremost. IF we must build there then we should try and transplant or do as little damage as possible. I choose solar over wind in my answers as solar is less of an eyesore. But my honest option is that this little island is too full of people, maybe we should be thinking about that, before we build on what's left of free land."
1927,I think we need to develop appropriate sites for their appropriate use
466,I think we need to leave some land undeveloped in order to leave soils some opportunity to regenerate and reduce their over-intensive use.
1280,I think we really need to get into renewable energy and using previously industrialised brownfield sites is the best way to find space for this
1707,"I think we should be doing more to protect wildlife, including that found on brownfield sites."
1655,I think we should be very careful before developing important land. Sectioning areas for redevelopment in an environmentally friendly way is the most important thing.
1479,I think we should build on brownfield sites
267,I think we should ensure that immigration is reduced and anyone that is here illegally should be returned to their own country and then maybe we wouldn't need to build so many houses
947,"I think we should keep those that are rich in wildlife but manage them to be accessible to the public. Those with no benefit to wildlife should be used for social housing, or renewable energy"
513,I think we should look at bringing more housing into town centres to revitalise them and enable people to shop without cars and go to school by bike.
1125,"I think we should try to make new housing, particularly estates, attractive rather than looking ugly, nasty and instrusive"
22,i think wildlife should always be a priority
528,"I think wildlife should always be prioritised, and homes should be either bought back off private landlords or them forced to charge an affordable rent so people have better access to the homes already available. Also, there is lots of homes in the UK that are empty, more should be done to take these homes back for people to live in."
782,"I understand the need for housing and so think all sites should be reviewed and those with no wildlife prioritised for housing, then those with wildlife prioritised for nature."
1606,"I was assuming brownfield was abandoned mills or buildings, which I would prefer to be used for housing."
545,"I was only able to get partial images/pictures, some items non at all. I have checked my download speeds and they seem okay"
2094,I WAS QUITE FLUMMOXED BY THE QUESTIONS
273,I was unaware brownfield sites could be valuable
2124,"I wasn't aware that brownfield sites had often been repossessed by nature! They still need to be thoroughly cleared of rubbish and other dangerous dumped or left material, the removal of toxic waste - I would rather inner city 'brown-field' sites were developed before land on the edge of towns/cities"
1916,I wish that we had more open space to just roam in and that not everything had to be built on / developed / managed.
1902,I wish they would stop building industrial units on them. There is one in our area and a company put planning permission in under the pretence they were going to create an amazing shopping complex for the local area they then used covid as an excuse as to why they cant do that anymore and are now building an industrial unit and houses.
1920,I would always prefer they be left for wildlife but do understand some are needed for housing
1832,I would hope that as many brownfield sites as possible remain undeveloped in an effort to preserve wildlife
135,"I would like to see less housing being built on brownfield sites, it would be better to upgrade/improve existing housing, or reuse old housing sites for new buildings."
1548,I would like to see quality housing building
1218,I would not like any of these sites in my immediate vicinity as I would be worried that they would be turned over to housing which is all very well if it didn't bring cars with it.
378,I would prefer brownfield sites and undeveloped sites to be used in a way that benefits wildlife but if that's not possible I'd like them to be repurposed into sites for renewable sources of energy (preferably while still benefiting wildlife).
585,I would prefer brownfield sites to be used to address housing needs in preference to greenbelt or undeveloped land.
99,I would prefer that these sites are used with a sympathetic development with the community and environment rather than developing green belt land
192,I would prefer them to be built on rather than green field sites
873,I would prefer they had a use which was not heavy industry or housing.
53,I would prefer to see nature reserves with no public access.
2082,I would prefer to use brownfield sites over green in order to enrich the community with varied uses including renovated green spaces for wildlife and locals. Where this cannot be achieved the sites should be used to provide affordable housing preferably social housing
2,I would prioritise preserving wildlife habitats over anything else.
848,I would rather see brown field sites used for housing instead of green belt
1520,I’d prefer investment made into nature reserves
2031,"I’m 33, live in the south east and my first house is going to cost me £350k. If anything, block international developers from buying our houses and give us a shot at owning our own home to contribute to the economy as opposed to paying a mortgage until death."
1478,I’m seeing more and more previously undeveloped sites around me being used for housing - most of it farmland. I would much rather see brownfield sites used for housing needs.
2202,I’m sure there are a lot of brownfield sites in the uk and these should be developed as they are an eyesore to the countryside
2029,I'd like to see more factories to provide jobs.
1161,I'd like to see more of them protected if they're a valuable area for wildlife.
776,I'd love to see far more re-wilding.
708,"I'd prefer to see new housing and other development on most brownfield sites (those low in biodiversity) rather than on good agricultural land, which is a valuable resource which we are just wasting at the moment by concreting it over,"
2193,If a brownfield is used to fit in with the surroundings it’s better but wind farms should be on hills or out at sea.
944,If a site is rich with wildlife it should be managed as a nature reserve.
1113,If already rich in wildlife that should be the first consideration.
1117,"If any area is beneficial to wildlife, it should be protected"
259,"If hanited by wildlife, leave alone."
1560,If housing is built on these sites it should be affordable as a priority.
105,"If housing is going to be built on land that is unoccupied, it should be made to be more affordable"
1678,If it is a home for wildlife then it should be left alone
406,If it’s got rare wildlife in the area you should not build houses or industry on it
598,If no wildlife then where possible used for housing
1313,If on floodplain then let nature have it
2130,If suitable for wildlife should be used for benefits of local community. If not housing so it saves building on green
2070,"If the area is rich in wildlife, developed or not, it should be preserved for wildlife. Any new development, housing or otherwise must be built with large areas of wildlife friendly design."
1470,If the ground is not suited to nature it should be beneficial to the local community
2020,"If the land is full of wildlife then it should be preserved or enhanced to maintain the space and make public areas ie nature reserves, activity centres. Unused land, derelict and waste land should be made into housing estates, or used as solar/wind farms."
1896,If the opportunity to enhance the rich wildlife then that's the way forward. Building on a wildlife enriched area would be unfair to diminish what has ready .are it's home.
574,"If there is rich wildlife then this should be protected in some way. If there isn't then I would like it to be encouraged by making a nature reserve. If local housing is needed, then brownfield sites without wildlife should always be used BEFORE any undeveloped land."
1794,If there is wildlife there it should not be developed into a housing or industrial estate
1121,If there’s wildlife in Abu dance then try and preserve it
1980,If they are close to other housing use for more housing.....clean the rest up as nothing of any importance grows in contaminated sites
676,"If they are going to build housing on them, these should be small affordable homes, apartments and bungalows- not luxury or large family detached properties. Also, if a large housing estate is to be built on them, they should also build schools, doctors surgeries and shops for them too to cut down on traffic having to leave the estate to access these services."
1984,If they contain wildlife they should be protected and encouraged as it benefits all as green spaces do wonders for well being
1908,"If they encourage wildlife but not crime, I'd be happy to seem them locally."
730,If they have acquired a community use - that ia a good thing = but they do need to be safe - which means 'someone' taking responsibility
954,"If they have wildlife, make it accessible to the public and protect the animals and plants. If not, make it into something we could use as a renewable or non-fossils fuel related energy source. I’m surprised that Nuclear Power wasn’t an option, considering that would be, by far, the best use of some of these sites."
777,If this loaded quicker (7 mins is unacceptable - you said my time precious) and was less boring you might have got some honest answers. I simply wanted to get to the end.
1438,iF USED FOR HOUSING THERE SHOULD BE AN EMPHASIS ON tRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING
1711,"If used for housing, more variety of types of property should be considered e.g. more property suitable for older people not just families."
133,I'm aware housing is needed but sites rich in wildlife should only be used if they can be developed sympathetically with nature
1944,"I'm conscious that I have put housing low on my list of priorities throughout, but I do think brownfield sites should be used before undeveloped ones for housing."
592,I'm in favour of brownfield sites being repurposed BUT the repurposing must be handled sensitively and full consultation should be carried out with both local residents and wildlife experts/authorities.
1051,I'm still not entirely sure what it is.
2119,Important and worth it
920,In a urban environment brownfield sites should be used for housing or industrial use
1265,"In any case, brownfield or not, these sites must be looked after in terms of pollution and litter."
1404,"In urban areas creatively use for housing, community projects ........... in rural situations develop to enhance the environment, create homes for local young people"
1969,Inner city and urban brownfield sites should be used for housing ahead of greenfield development. In rural areas if housing is essential then brownfield is preferable to greenfield but it is not usually available in the required areas. In these cases development more sympathetic to the environment is needed
1757,Inner city brownfield sites should be prioritised for new housing etc. Not Greenfields
1743,Inner city brownfield sites should be used for housing (low rise).
1857,interesting
1887,Interesting and educative
2054,Interesting topic. I wish they'd do more beneficial things to these sites instead of wasting them on pointless housing projects. So many could be turned into beautiful nature attractions.
1209,It doesn't make any sense to keep building on land that is valuable to wildlife when we are losing biodiversity at such an alarming rate
1689,It has educated me on what brownfield sites actually are
1027,"It is a much more complex and involved matter than your survey can represent, with so many factors that do not appear in your survey (and cannot, because of the numbers of such factors involved), so your survey is at best a blunt and inprecice tool."
982,It is better to limit these and unless they are rich in wildlife should be used
182,"It is difficult to generalise on brownfield sites, but in every case, the local opinion of residents, councils, businesses etc. should be taken into account."
1816,It is difficult to make a developer pay all the costs of clearing and cleaning brownfield sites.
334,It is essential to have green space. Building unaffordable housing on these sites is only beneficial to the developers or the wealthy and not the community as a whole
1213,"It is important that the environmental impact is considered and that bio diversity is encouraged. However, affordable housing is important and some brownfield sites may be ideal. The location of sites must be an influence in decision making."
763,"It is important that we don’t build on all available waste land. People need areas to be able to walk, run, cycle, etc."
1028,"It is impossible to answer these questions. Each brownfield site decision should be made depending on the surrounding area. If there is little green area and dense housing then it should be a managed wildlife site or have some agricultural or energy producing function. If there are few house, then it should be built on. Land is so precious in England it should always be managed, no matter how wild it is allowed to be."
1075,It is really nice to see housing estates built with wild areas integrated within the estates for wildlife to continue flourishing. I do think though that more land should be reserved for wildlife than people!
2213,It is strange that you don’t include sites with buildings in the survey. One of the biggest problems with some brownfield sites is the removal of pollution and this needs some serious research but is not a barrier in this century. Too much support is given to development of greenfield sites for housing.
326,It is the first time I have ever heard of a brownfield site.
780,It is vitally important weekend these sites as they are the corridors for nature. We take these corridors away and nature dies.
1536,"It makes sense to use brownfield sites for housing wherever possible, rather than encroaching on more of the countryside."
563,It needs to be a green pollution free use
725,It needs to be nurtured and brought back
1245,"It really depends on each individual site as to what the best use is. Preserving wildlife and generating renewable energy must be priorities, followed by affordable housing."
71,"It seems sensible to develop urban brownfields especially for housing - but it is a different matter in the countryside. Every single site has its own qualities and there should be no blanket policies applied everywhere. Especially in rural areas, local people should be properly consulted and LISTENED TO."
1575,It seems that the answers to previous questions have been ‘fixed’. Lots of IT issues which did not accept my preferred answers.
688,It seems there is little point in filling this in while we have a government with a ‘build build build ‘ ethos. Inevitably this means housing!
1109,It will descend into endless legal challenge and will never progress anywhere.
1692,it would be best if they split some so nature is at your door step
362,It would be better if more brownfield sites where left to revert to nature and ban repurposing of greenfield sites to encourage a greater respect for nature and our dwindling enviroment in the UK
1830,It would be better to try and turn them into something
83,It would be good if the land could be used for some positive purpose.
1091,It would be good to see them all gone. I know there are already plans for some not far from here.
1443,"It would be great if there were some other options, e.g. planting woodland."
1836,"It would be nice to have a site which could be sectioned off for wildlife but also available for recreation and dog walking. The perfect example is Buchan Park, Crawley"
1309,It would be nice to see areas developed to help wildlife flourish
726,It would be nice to see Brownfields utilised in a way that fits in and is a benefit to the local community.
1785,It’s a great idea to take old and damaged areas and do something positive with them
257,It’s a hard decision to make as we are loosing so many beautiful areas to building companies I understand that these are somewhat essential but I was bought up on a semi built up area which slowly became more built up I have moved into a semi rural area and love the fact it isn’t overly developed so I err on the side of no extra development but am torn as I understand it can be essential .
1383,It’s very difficult to comment on a hypothetical area and site!
1061,"Its all about balance. We've especially learnt recently how important green and open spaces are. I appreciate there is a need for housing and industry but I feel for years this has overtaken the social and community need for open spaces, and the global need for greener energy"
696,Its better to use these sites for housing where there is little or no value to wildlife and they can be cleaned up
1766,it's good for the housing crisis
44,It's hard to apply the same logic and rules to all brownfield sites as they are all so diverse.
1753,"It's impossible to generalise, so much depends on whereabouts of brownfield site. Green corridors are important for flora and fauna but space has to be found for housing and industry. Local consultation is a must"
1364,Its mainly due to policy by local authorities as to whether these type of sites are used in a good way and if they could be well developed from housing to nature reserves and used for the local community
1424,It's not something I am particularly bothered about.
527,Its soewhat falsehypotheses - you can't really answer honestly without knowing circumstancs of site and community n thngs like what sort of housing... eg it might be that 'passiv' and genuinely affordable housing were preferable to bio crops ..and also 1-8 markings are impossible whre maybe 2 or 3 options are feasible and teh rest absolutely beyond the pale!
539,"It's unhelpful to talk about brownfield sites without describing them eg dangerous, biodiverse, etc."
590,"just because an area of land is not rich in wildlife, does not mean that this could change with the right land use and management. A feature you don't mention for these sites would be allotments"
196,Just because its a brownfield site it doesnt mean its ok to build on
136,Just hope they get used correctly
55,Just leave all green belt land untouched !!!!
1228,Just leave nature alone to thrive & survive & stop digging it up for man.
812,Just make use of bad land and leave the good land to the wildlife. We need that more than housing.
1200,Just not interested in this survey or Brownfields
973,"Just that I am very much in favour of rewilding, in order to have as much natural diversity as possible."
240,Keep as much green space as possible
1321,Keep as much natural landscape as possible
1040,Keep for wildlife not housing
1397,"Keep green areas, encourage wildlife and wind power is better out at sea as such an eyesore."
855,Keep green sites green .
1418,"Keep it natural, then make it renewable, never about consumption"
2089,Keep sites for wildlife
277,Keep the sites rich in wild life undeveloped
2111,Keep the wildlife in this country a top of a priority as you do housing!
1522,Keep them undeveloped please !!!
1162,Keep these landscapes natural
549,Keep wildlife safe
1021,"Land in the U.K. must be used in a more environmentally friendly way, with nature put at the forefront, including planting trees and having lots of green space. Any housing should be eco friendly, fitted with solar panels and on a scale and design that fits with the local area."
1991,Land is used poorly in the UK. New build properties are low in quality and uninhabited properties owned by overseas individuals or landlords could be sued to house the homeless.
1112,Land is very valuable we need to take care of it and nurture it it should be used to enhance and live with nature.
883,Land needs to be freed up and available for housing: however there should not be too much infill and green belt should be preserved.
124,Land should always be utilised to the best of its ability.
1484,Land should always have a use ie building wildlife energy renewable
428,Land should be assessed for impact to wildlife before any changes are made to it
2145,Land should be developed in accordance with its surroundings and what benefits the surrounding area the most.....not the best funanacially
1675,"Land should be used for what is in demand. If it's houses, build houses. If it's something else, do something else. Let the market decide, not silly planning rules."
1444,Land should be used to protect nature.
84,last few questions were flawed
1632,leave as is
1459,Leave countryside alone. Stop building houses everywhere.
1098,Leave it to nature where possible
1587,"Leave land alone that is not brownfield. Wind farms are too intrusive and can be noisy. Housing not preferred in nice countryside areas, would prefer a user that did not lead to increased pollution, traffic, demand on unsuitable local resources"
101,Leave our country some green areas
820,Leave Scotlands wildlife alone and don't disturb our lands
1201,Leave the way it is.
991,Leave them alone
1974,Leave them alone
86,Leave them alone or rewild.
993,"less houses, more biodiversity"
1733,"Less housing, more renewable energy & focus on nature"
1573,Let them return to nature preferably with public access. Otherwise housing if absolutely necessary.
1366,Living in areas that have no natural spaces is depressing
1048,Local councils SHOULD NOT be overulled by central government as is the case in the fields in front of my house where deer graze in the field and a colony of bats fly around at night. Not since new housing has commenced building work on the fields.
1074,Local gov should offer incentives to small/new starter business to develop brownfield sites
2131,Local people should decide what is best for their community . Best use as a not for profit basis
1169,Local people should have a say in what to do with brownfield sites
2008,Local views should be a first consideration not government set quotas. Should also be based on local needs and local employment opportunities and local affordability
456,"locals should be consulted service needs, to be taken into consideration traffic pollution, wild life, and if housing a scheme that is for social housing given priority"
1581,Look at brownfield sites to develop rather than greenfield
1953,Looking at the current rate of development both in and around cities all green belts are turning to big developments. It has to be stopped before it gets worse.
1448,"lots of new builds around here -please keep advising and advertising for more natural areas, more wilder gardens, more tree planting."
43,Made in to areas for people to enjoy
617,Major cities still need green space open to the public - many benefits
1952,make sure that when you build house's the infrastructure is in place before you start building
117,Make them into country parks
2091,mani brownfoeld can be used for redevelopment
1273,Many are used inappropriately - eg reserved for transport access then after long delays handed to housing developers
41,"Many brownfield sites, near large urban areas, would be better turned into green spaces to add nature and wildlife to heavily built up areas."
313,Maybe the business what are near to this kind of site showld have a decreases in taxe what the pay if they will mentain those filds and they will flourish mabe with new plants and wild life .
1345,Mines and quarries in my local area have been changed to nature reserves and solar generation. It is an improvement but the local youth have taken over some areas to race bikes drug taking and drinking. So not the perfect solution.
1884,Monoculture agriculture is disastrous for biodiversity. There should be more incentives to provide areas for wildlife.
2099,more affordable housing should be a prioity as too many rough sleepers and younger ppl not able to get on the property ladder
1348,More affordable Retirement Flats and Bungalows would free up more Housing for young Families with children
429,"More effort should be put into housing and industry, to make it greener and more wildlife friendly, and more green space should be available to all people (not just dog walkers). Plus people should be more educated to protect and look after wildlife and wild spaces, this in tern will help peoples wellbeing."
553,"More enlightened use of these sites, with reference to potential local flooding."
220,More homes are needed
1850,More housing
1090,More housing is needed
1004,More housing with landscaping and other facilities would be a bonus
1584,More nature reserves and solar set ups would be amazing.
118,More outdoor space should be provided for the public. But also housing too. However if there is wildlife and biodiversity on the brownfield space this should be given over to the local communities for use.
1337,More should be used for the benefit of the whole communities for instance community halls.
1862,More social housing countrywide
506,More the better
1516,More thought given to the decline in hedgehogs and their natural habitats
779,More undeveloped sites should be used for wildlife with public access
2161,More use must be made of brownfield sites. Housing must be moved away from the south east of England and moved to other areas of the country.
1881,Most are nice areas of land
159,"Much depends on local circumstances and needs eg; housing provision, recreational needs etc Schemes must be flexible."
145,much more use of these sites should be enabled.
19,much of it could be managed and used in far better ways than it is currently - people need more open places to visit for fresh air and to get awayfrom it all.
2162,"Much of 'new' housing is very ugly, poor quality. When I look at houses built 70-100+ years ago, the styling is much more attractive; and built to last. So I don't see new housing as being a good option when I think of these."
146,must be developed
2068,"My heart says wildlife and biodiversity is extremely important but so, too, is renewable energy. Different types of the latter have different pros and cons. More genuinely affordable housing is needed. There is plenty if land being used for house building already but with focus on profit. Switch that around to build affordable housing and leave other areas for wildlife and renewable energies."
1628,My idea of what you were referring to as brownfield sites was initially more of disused and abandoned factory/industrial sites rather than just undeveloped/unused land.
2064,My perception and understanding of them has changed after doing this survey
1630,My preference is always nature over building
1604,Nature has a way of repairing itself. Human intervention is often worse than leaving well alone.
1773,Nature needs to progress
882,Nature reserves and energy production far outweighs undeveloped land
451,"Nature reserves are such valuable assets to any community in the UK. Not only do they create jobs and encourage time in nature, but they support biodiversity and can even lead to some ecotourism. Brownfield and undeveloped sites are perfect for nature reserves, even if they aren't already rich in wildlife."
870,Nature reserves should be a priority
2186,Nature reserves that don't do rewinding are often useless
1104,NATURE RESERVES WHEREVER POSSIBLE
1491,Nature will always claim back what was taken from it. The world needs to embrace this and allow nature to thrive
57,natutre
1899,Need for consistency in planning and use of all land
1513,Need green spaces
797,Need to be put to some use to gain benefits whatever they may be to the uk
978,need to encourage bio diversity as much as possible
1569,Need to keep a balance
1975,Needs careful management and not just typical council sign offs to high bidders
54,needs managing carefully into the future.
144,needs to be better defined
494,Needs to be manage more carefully that it is now
571,Needs to be used to provide affordable housing using renewable products
2061,New build houses should have bigger gardens and more consideration for wildlife.
1669,"New housing mainly benefits the developers building them and often there is no provision for a wildlife green space as it means less profit which drive wildlife further away, All new housing porject still do not provision for the environment again due to profit margins, all should be fitted with solar panels and rain harvesting roofing to collect and supply toilet and garden water before using normal resevoir water, this would also help during droubts as the water could eaily be filtered for other uses. New housong project to be forced to include areas on the estate where bird nesting areas and other wildlife should be encouraged (perhaps not accessible to the residents to allow the wildlife to thrive, along with protection as best can be from cats). Brownfield sites should be taken back into the community once they have been standing for more than 7 years as its clear re-purposing will only be required should their be a opportunity for profit, meanwhile now effort has been made to mai"
1602,"New housing needs to blend and respect nature, ban artificial grass for new builds"
2245,Nightmare
318,"No ""one sized fits all"" view - management should depend on community view"
1702,"No brownfield should be left untouched, encouraging nature to grow is never a bad thing"
247,No building should be permitted on brownfield sites on flood plains.
1576,No further comment apart from some brownfield development is needed for more housing but wildlife is important too
841,No further industrial sites
48,No greenfield land should used until all brownfield sites have been used
1168,"No land should be left unused if at all possible, however expensive, when there is such a shortage of housing, and shortage of land for other purposes. The more land used for green energy and food production the better, so that we become self sufficient."
612,"No matter what sites they are, it is still important that they are being maintained so as not to create places for crimes, anti-social behaviours, or pollutions. It is OK to leave the site empty and unused but not OK if it causes negative impacts to the nearby environment."
2028,"No more houses in small villages , more space for wildlife"
1558,No more houses please. Let's grow our industry and agriculture.
2185,No more new housing
1873,"No point in using sites for housing unless suitable infrastructure in place, which often is not the case. Use also depends on surrounding area and how it would be affected."
1878,"No thank you, the only thing is with regards to the last questions (1-8 scale) very hard to answer on a phone, just fiddly and frustrating"
877,no to the sites
2151,"no, quite an interesting topic though"
227,"not a choice I like to make we need biodiversity, we need housing, we need renewal energy so the answer is reduce the human population then we will not need so much"
2183,Not all brown field sites are the same and they shouldn't be treated the same way. If there is to be development on them then it needs to be the right type of development which fits in with the surrounding area and current usage.
1585,"Not all brownfield sites should be used for housing, some sites should be left as they are and planted with wild flowers"
1134,Not an especially good survey design.
328,Not an important matter to me
2118,Not as I expected
1129,Not being familiar with brownfield sites my opinion is that whatever development takes place should be sympathetic to the local population and 100% environmentally friendly
1118,Not enough information to make any kind of judgment.
1225,"not enough options on the questions, wind farms, solar farms etc will very soon be old technology"
999,Not much point asking if you can't place a selection in your chosen place!!
2233,Not something that I am very concerned about.
2123,"Of course we should re-develop brownfield sites but there is plenty of unoccupied properties in the UK, owned solely for investment which should be also acquired for housing"
1460,Old building should be re-possed and made into flats/bedsits & other housing for the homeless
413,on the questions some of the answers would be the same you are not allowing us a choice of answer this does not show a balance as you are preventing this so the answers are being manipulated
1049,"One option that you haven’t outlined is that which a nearby village has adopted - they have created an area of woodland and open green space simply for public enjoyment. It is managed, but isn’t a nature reserve. My own picture of a typical brownfield site is one with the remains or footings of industrial buildings still in place and which should be transformed, with sensitive planning, as quickly as possible to housing, leisure space (or even, as a last resort) industry."
582,Only development should be on brownfield sites
2192,Only that we should redevelop such sites before any greenfield.
661,"Onshore renewable energy production is a blight on the landscape. No new facilities apart from bio-digestion types, should be approved."
2244,Open them up so people can enjoy nature
1730,People need affordable housing. Affordable meaning affordable. Social housing that's decent quality needs to be built.
1120,People need housing but people also need nature so large areas of building is not the way to go and Brown sites can give people the nature they need in already built up areas.
580,Perhaps the term 'brownfield site' needs to be refined and several definitions applied in the same way as you have done in this survey. Most people's idea of a brownfield site is post industrial and only fit for housing or further industry.
1635,Pictures were slow to come and difficult to see so I was unable to give positive answers.
552,Planning is far to complicated to enable redevelopment
39,Play areas
1452,Please build housing with a view to more public transport usage as opposed to estates where car ownership is necessary
1700,"Please do not build on undeveloped sites and protect nature! The new houses being built are not built to last, they are cheap, terrible quality and are not fit for purpose. I would never buy a new build house, especially a new build on a undeveloped piece of land"
372,"Please do not cover every inch of land in the UK with housing. Please stick to brownfield sites and, if necessary, undeveloped sites but leave green belt land alone and other green areas."
937,Please don't develop them
265,Please find a better layout for ranking questions lol
2240,Please give us more points for these surveys
2215,Please stop using farmland and use the brownfield sites instead. But we do not need any more housing! It is ruining our countryside.
1308,Please use brownfield sights before green belt land!!!!!
1106,Prefer undeveloped sites to be left. Humans always mess things up. Better to reuse brownfield land. Always leave undisturbed undeveloped land to nature. Reuse old city buildings to make flats.
1770,Preference would be for brownfield sites that have been left to rot and become eyesores & dangerous for locals to venture into to be used up first.
1380,Problem is always funding v climate awareness
177,"propably best for housing but also schools and hospitals, police etc.!"
765,Protect the future and be responsible for the decisions you make now.Whatever the local councils/government decisions are concerning these areas..remember what you do with them is a legacy.
14,Protect the wildlife as much as possible.
886,Protect wildlife and their environment
1111,Public access is encouraged until development.
2078,Public needs to be kept informed and consulted
434,Quality with security against anti social behaviour
805,Question too simplistic
233,"Questions and answers depend on what kind of Brownfield site it is, you can't generalize."
830,"Questions are not sensible and misleading. Every piece of land is different and will have different attributes - location (near to other resources, housing, industry, etc.) and this survey is too general. What applies to a piece of land in my town of Wolverhampton can produce completely different responses depending on where in the town we are talking about. Now apply that thinking to the remainder of the West Midlands, England, the UK.... every area is different."
487,Questions aren't that clear
1665,Quite confusing
1673,Re industrialisation should be done if at all in away causing least damage to the environment
2231,Really don't know enough about this subject
1103,Really of no interest to me
432,Redevelopment of such land depends on the context
959,Reduce profit margins for developers
980,Reduce the population; give more consideration as to whether there is sufficient water to support the increase in the local populous; consider what effect building has on flooding in the area
1852,"Relatively little of the UK is has been built upon, therefore we have a lot of space. I believe that areas that are especially beneficial to wildlife should be identified and completely preserved, while other areas are set towards helping eliminate the housing and renewable energy crises that we are facing"
199,Reponsises where not as I stated.
1081,Repurpose them for the benefit of nature
2041,Restrict housing to urban areas
1774,Return to nature - end of
1052,Rewild areas. More areas needed for conservation. More areas needed for public to walk/run/cycle in green areas. No more new houses!
474,rewilding should be considered as an option. Use brownfield sites first where available if development absolutely necessary.
1842,Rubbish manipulative
1709,sadly people need housing
1351,Shoul;d be used in preference to greenfield development
109,Should be cleared of pollution before development
1983,should be developed as affordable housing
609,Should be developed for bioderversity or community use
356,Should be first for development.
573,Should be laws made to use up all this land before any other land is used
694,Should be made safe
1786,should be made the most of
1959,Should be secure to prevent asb
1388,"Should be under democratic control of local community. All development to be sustainable & carbon neutral. Sites may be poor in wildlife to begin with, but after removal of hazardous materials, with judicious planting, wildlife will always find ways to take over"
899,should be used as nature reserves too much housing being built in inappropiate places
2165,Should be used before class A arable land
464,Should be used for affordable housing
1127,should be used for the good of the local community. use to be determined locally
1506,Should be used to help nature
680,Should be used to promote nature
493,"Should encourage unused land for agricultural products such as vegetables, fruit and arable farm to be more self sufficient, therefore reduce imports thus reduce carbon footprint."
908,should keep more for plants and wild life before we lose it all
1619,Should look at all options
869,Should preserve sites of use to wildlife and nature and not fill with housing or use them for general development.
1205,Should protect more sites
2071,Should remain undeveloped.
1918,Should use brownfield sites rather than the country side
1512,Should use for housing
1546,Sick of green potential farm land being taken over for housing and solar farms
1036,Silly questions! It depends where you live. If you live in a post industrial area it's very different to if you live in a rural or pretty area.
1372,"Site where there is an abundance of wildlife and wildflowers should remain as they are, either managed or unmanaged. Sites where there is little wildlife should be used carefully for renewable energy and enhanced for wildlife."
385,"Sites rich in biodiversity should be managed by the proper agency. As it happens, I do volunteer work with the county Countryside Management Service, and am very active in this."
1843,Sites rich in wildlife should be preserved for the good of the local plant and animal life. Sites with minimal wildlife would be more valuable if repurposed as a site to generate renewable energy or as a site for affordable housing.
905,"Sites that can be protected for both wildlife and human enjoyment, should be so used. Otherwise, they should be used for the most pressing needs, e.g. housing, renewable energy etc."
1912,Small brownfield sites in inner cities should be used for housing or nature not just left to be used by fly tippers
347,small towns are becoming far too big for the infrastructure available. This needs addressing in my opinion
1744,"solar and wind sites and anaerobic digesters should only be as far away from where people live as possible,"
1867,Solar farms can also be a site of special scientific and nature interest
1239,solar panels are the biggest waste of space and provide very little for the size of the field
1166,some are good others are bad all depends what they use it for
338,"Some large brownfield site should be of multiple use with housing and conservation / wildlife area, It shouldn't be a choice of either or ither"
692,Some of it must be left as nature reserves for flora and fauna
1066,"some of my answers may be ""coloured"" by the fact that my family have a solar farm area on their land,"
1011,Some of the images shown do not look like they should be classed as brown field
1067,Some of these questions seem very poorly thought out and a waste of time completing
2033,Some real tough choices to make in those last questions
1769,Some similar need tobe used for housing
1226,Some sites described as brownfield sites have been reclaimed by nature (e.g. old quarries) do perhaps the definition of 'brownfield' needs revising.
2157,"Sometimes area like this can be used by kids hanging out, that can be a good thing."
1810,"Spaces for wildlife are limited, it would be great to have something like this that is. It going to be built on"
964,still worried about pollution
1747,Stop building houses in the countryside
2003,Stop building houses without low-cost options in over-crowded cities.
903,"Stop building housing, there's plenty of old buildings and unused land in towns and cities. Absolutely no need to build extra housing in the countryside. Especially when the infrastructure doesn't support the current residents, let alone the extra people."
137,Stop building new properties and redevelop existing buildings!!!! Regenerate not destroy
96,Stop building on green belt. Highest possible protection should be given to nature.
365,"Stop building, greenfield sites are being used"
399,"Stop developing in areas where there is not sufficient requirements such as schooling, doctors, sewage space etc."
625,Stop leaving sites unused either make natural sites or useful low impact businesses
808,Stop ruining land. Protect wildlife protect bees ban pesticides and stop building on flood plains
415,"Such sites should be considered as part of local and regional development plans, with services, infrastructure and environmental impact informing decisions"
1768,Supply more social housing as a matter of urgency
1093,Survey too complicated
1163,Thanks I have learned a lot.
1578,"That any development should involve the public and be subject to full transparency about its use, Where it is possible and without some monstrous and cheap development be made available for housing as there is a national housing shortage"
1706,That grid is encouraging really lazy answers. Sorry. I can tell you’re trying to bias the sample.
865,The concern of underlying health issues
1526,The country needs to ensure suitable brown field sites are utilised before use of undeveloped land is considered .
1561,The decisions about brownfield sites should be made by local communities and not outsiders who have their own agendas.
1749,"The definition of a 'brownfield site' encompasses too large a range of possible attributes of an area of land to be useful in designating how land should be redeveloped, for e.g. setting a target on the number of brownfield sites to be redeveloped."
94,"The development of such sites depends on size, context and location."
987,"The first free text question was vaguely worded, didn't think I answered in a way that is helpful"
668,"The government should address second homes, buy to let and empty properties first."
1341,"The government should build on brownfield sites first, then only build on greenfield sites as a last resort."
1620,The government should stop large supermarkets from buying brownfield sites and sitting on them for years.
719,"The housing problem (specifically affordable housing equal to average salary and borrowing) needs to be solved. It is already overdue by around 20 years. Building on brownsites for this purpose makes for common sense. However, building luxury £300-400k+ houses and apartments does not solve the primary issue. Which is what keeps happening and leaving average young people in a perpetual state of not quite poverty, but also not quite advancing in life. It’s monumentally difficult living in this country if you are under 40 and don’t have rich parents who can provide vast sums for deposits, even more so if you are single. The rent market needs to be capped, similar to Germany. At least they know they won’t be able to buy homes, but they still have more money in their pocket each month because of their designed system."
188,"The images you showed of 'brownfield sites' that had obviously been left to become overgrown and - to some degree - to be 'reclaimed' by nature were potentially misleading, as they may have contained large amounts of highly toxix chemicals in the soil, water courses, etc."
738,The land has to be owned by some legal body (person/organisation) and they need to be brought to task when brownfield land is abandoned.
2095,The last 12 months has shown how much people appreciate places to walk when they live in a highly populated area and one of these places locally was a brownfield site
163,"The level of surveying to determine whether a brownfield site will eventually have problems with industrial contaminants needs to be suitable, otherwise there is going to be a health crisis in the area within five years of development. This means it must be done by the civil service who have no agenda rather than a private firm."
1320,The local community should be consulted regarding any future plans of brownfield sites
250,The local context is vital is deciding how land should be used. Local need and provision must be considered.
2218,The locals should vote on each site.
1898,The location of any Brownfield site should always be considered in relation to the environment around it and should always add value to the community. This value is not always about £
560,the name brownfield is misleading - brownfield can be green and greenfield sites brown !
1967,The need for more housing is the overriding problem of the age.
1979,The need for new housing cannot be ignored and brownfield sites are generally preferable to use.
762,"The need to develop new housing is minimal, there are more homes in the uk than are needed to house the whole population. Should prioritise development of brownfield areas for environmental purposes"
1999,The options given in the questions are too stark. In determining land use you have to take account of local circumstances and the balanced needs of communities.
814,"The photos and questions have not covered sites where there are remnants of the original development (abandoned buildings, debris etc) which are the ones which cause most concern. None of the sites in the photos was an eyesore."
2113,"The phrasing of the questions and the choices given are woefully inadequate. It would probably be difficult to include all the possible variables but the results from this topic will be all almost meaningless without more context being provided. I would like to congratulate whomever chose the photographs, is one supposed to assume the view behind the camera matches that in front? Perhaps accompanying wider aerial views might have improved the results. Whoever is responsible for the future creation of a brownfield site should also be responsible for reinstating it's original condition."
112,The picture round has made me wonder how strict the GOV guidelines are in defining 'brownfield' and whether or not greenfield sites are being exploited...
58,"The planet is the priority, then housing."
1247,"the planet needs all the help, no more clement need as we seem to be getting more rain"
1069,The previous pages were difficult to fill in so it’s no5 representative.
1146,The public should be made aware if new building work ie housing are being built in these places
223,The questions did not allow my answers to be recorded as I wished. Inputting a choice in row one sterilised that choice in subsequent rows and so on for the whole set.
1305,"The questions were really difficult to answer because so much depends on context. If an area of ""little value to wildlife"" is ""available"" for re-purposing, it is possible that that area could be helped to have greater value to wildlife as is happening in various parts of the country. The areas that currently considered of little value to wildlife may improve greatly with gentle and appropriate management."
141,The questions were too difficult to think about
90,"The reason I put housing as low priority is because it puts pressure on local facilities such as doctors, dentists etc"
56,"The selection of sites for various forms of development should be informed by their current status and future potential, not their previous use. Many former industrial sites are now valuable wildlife habitats because of the rare soil nutrient conditions created by their former use, e.g. quarrying, whereas greenfield farmed areas are often a source of pollution and carbon and nitrogen emissions."
1194,The survey will not allow the user to select the same line twice.....the survey is duff
103,"The UK desperately needs more housing, but there must be a balance to protect our wildlife and rural areas. Once it's gone, it's gone for good."
885,the uk has lots of land empty or used for farming - there is plenty space to cope sensibly with housing needs - there should continue to be nature reserves and they should be expanded in clearly defined areas for the support of biodiversity. use of land for solar adn wind power is not unattractive and provides sustainable energy so should be supported to expand
673,"The Uk, needs wildlife, it is sad to see housing being built on land, houses or social housing needs to build up not across"
716,The use of brownfield sites could be the solution to the lack of social housing.
948,"The use of brownfield sites should be prioritised and we should be seeking to protect wildlife on greenfield sites where possible but this should not be at the expense of providing much needed housing, particularly affordable housing, in sustainable locations."
359,"The view taken in this survey is too narrow, and ignores that brownfield sites are developed as a response to capitalism-related unchecked growth. We're a small island. We're overpopulated, overcommitted to unlimited growth, and we inhabit a planet that is being rendered uninhabitable for human beings. A much wider view is needed than simply seeing wild land as a development opportunity just so some over-affluent, barely human empathy vaccuum can line it's pockets."
438,The world needs no more factories.
1891,there are a few brownfield sites in my area which look unsightly
2069,There are a few of these sites near my area which are now nature reserves and are beautiful
1319,There are many brownfield sites in my area and I’m glad to see that redevelopment is taking place at last
2207,There are many questions to be answered about specific sites and each site will have it's own specific attributes in relation to benefitting other surrounding environments.
1057,"There are several areas of brown field sites in my area which integrate well I to the community and provide a breathing space fro roads,houses, and cars,we have held petitions to keep this land when it was suggested turning In to a road, this site houses fruit trees from old back gardens, the remains of an old canal locks, provides walk ways for local communities to take short cuts to work and school from home, it also forms part of the peninsula e way for cyclists walkers and much much more"
1667,There are so many debatable issues surrounding these options it’s almost impossible to provide a satisfactory or ‘valid’ response.
2222,"There are so many empty buildings that need developing before we start to dig into anymore countryside, and if any brownfield sites are to be used up then the wildlife must be considered first. We do not need more housing !"
1287,"There are too many abandoned mills, empty shops and buildings that need repurposing"
2140,There are too many brownfield sites in the UK. The Government should be putting more money into improving these sites.
2174,"There are too many houses being built on greenfield sites, which reduces our ability to grow our own food."
1963,There could also be a case for planting trees on these sites.
304,"There has to be a careful consideration about the toxicity of the soil, the location of the site and the wildlife for any decision to be made."
2150,"There is a lot of house building happening near me (Horsham) which appears to be on farmland, or land rich with wildlife. It seems to be far too much, too soon. There seems to be a large push for house building at the moment though little thought to the infrastructure. Just seem to be loosing a lot of nice farmland and nature sites."
147,There is a lot of land that is unused that could be put to better use
2114,There is a need for much more affordable housing so this is a good use of Brownfield sites - but it also important to support biodiversity and local fauna and flora - these don't need to be mutually exclusive. Creative solutions to provide eco-friendly affordable housing whilst providing open spaces for recreation and nature to thrive.
1325,There is a need to rethink the whole city landscape. Large stores are barely viable unless put in malls with car access.
1919,"There is a real shortage of affordable homes in the UK. Brownfield sites should be utilised accordingly. We must create more protected areas for biodiversity, especially pollinators etc."
665,There is a shortage of housing in this country for which brownfield sites should be used through an accelerated planning process
1490,There is an obvious shortage of affordable housing but this should not be prioritised over areas rich in wildlife
203,There is an old industrial area local to me that was knocked down nearly 10 years ago and has remained unused ever since. More information for the public on what it happening with such sites would be of use.
1742,"There is no perfect answer for the use of these sites, they all finish up with a compromise."
626,There is no point in building vast housing estates if the infrastructure is weak
279,There is nothing worse than areas with potential just being left idle.
281,There is too much housing and not enough green spaces
458,There should be less development and use sites that have already been used for work purposes and reuse them for some else
1860,There should be more examples of brownfield sites so people understand what they look like rather than picturing part built property being abandoned
422,"There should be more green spaces everything is been built so close together there is no breathing space for people. Industrial & warehouses are built close to housing estates causing more & more traffic, congestion & pollution."
1672,There should be more renewable energy site built in these places
1549,There should be no unused sites either make nature reserves or affordable housing
1275,There should be undeveloped sites in every town that allows wildlife to flourish
1634,"There was nothing in this survey about. inner city brownfield sites, where much work needs to be done to take advantage of the possibilities they offer"
1001,"There were a bunch of questions with yes/no answers. I just said yes to all as there was no option to say I don't know. Any site could be a brownfield site - it gets grassed over (naturally or purposefully), and after some years unless there are physical remains of old buildings / industry then it's pretty impossible to tell from a generic picture whether it is nature or brownfield. Any and all brownfield sites should have all contaminants removed from the land / any water, including from under the land / water prior to re-purposing."
1235,"There’s too much variation in the meaning of brownfield site as a term for this survey to have any value. And your grid answering, different numbers for each row, and cancelling ones that are the same, forcing one to tick numbers that aren’t genuine choices is mad."
604,These are definitely preferable over Greenfield though there is too much housing going up.
280,"These are important pockets of land which could be crucial to native wildlife, bees, birds etc. We do not need any more housing being built up on land better served for our environment"
534,"These looked like brownfield sites in the countryside, Unused or derelict brownfield sites in, or adjacent to, built-up areas are the ones that should be developed for housing. We need to keep as much of our countryside/rural areas as possible."
720,These past questions regarding Brownfield sites. The ones where you mark 1 to 8 you need to look at the set up. If you press 1on one line and 1 on another then the previous line is cancelled out. The only way you can complete the survey is to go 1 2 3 3 5 6 7 8 on separate lines. Which makes answering the questions TRUTHFULLY is IMPOSSIBLE. Please fix
1174,"These sites should be left as open spaces unless they are very polluted,then they need to be cleaned up."
1101,These sites should be used to maximise the potential for the environment
1073,They are a waste
1387,They are being turned into warehousing eyesores in this area with attendent traffic issues
519,They are fast disappearing and that would deprive people of green spaces for waking and exercising dogs.
444,They need a better name/branding change to appeal more.
1998,They need to be used for the community
230,they should all be left as open spaces
488,they should be cleaned up and managed as nature reserves
722,They should be remediated using pollution removal technology and microbiology techniques and brought into use
1805,They should be sorted for housing as I feel they’d the most thing needed in this country
1046,They should be used before farm land
1184,They should be used for housing etc before greenfield sites are considered. Local knowledge should also be aplied to these sites.
403,They should be used to benefit and good for the environment and people. No pollution or disturbance to wildlife or nearby homes.
45,They should be used to the maximum benefit to the local area and wildlife. definitely not for housing
1789,they should consider wildlife and spaces for people to go with climate change we need more open spaces
1880,"they should consider wildlife instead of housing as we need the bees and other wildlife to make sure we keep living, why cant they do up old houses instead?"
1382,They should not be automatically earmarked for low quality mass housing projects.
962,They should not remain dormant without public access.
316,They should only be developed if not rich in wildlife.
206,They shouldn't exist in the first place; neither should humans.
879,Things like fort Dunlop are good
2180,"Think care needs to be taken thinking that brownfield or greenfield sites lack nature, Nature only becomes absent or diminshed where people, and concrete, take over."
239,Think carefully before starting making plans
1338,Think there need to be more about
1084,Think there should be a country wide register of all brownfield sites
431,Think they should do more to reduce the population and /or use empty buildings before building new builds
114,"This country is overcrowded with buildings, we are an island we need open spaces, fill the empty houses before developing more."
1031,This government is not interested in the future of the environment. They will mortgage tomorrow for short term gains. Profit is the only motive this government has. The exploitation of all our habitats must be paramount. Our children will not thank us for paving over the planet merely for profit.
1509,"This has been possibly the most unhelpful series of questions I can remember encountering in a survey. I would have thought that it was universally acknowledged that you can find some sites, defined as brownfield, that appear to be quite ""natural"", that it can be the case that you cannot tell simply by looking at them and that the potential use for sites depends on many factors one could not possibly ascertain from a picture: from where they are situated to what lies underground or in the soil."
686,"This is a very complex topic with far reaching consequences beyond the scope of this survey eg immigration, population, housing needs and infrastructure availability to name but a few and while I have done my best to answer the questions I did find them extremely simplistic."
157,"This is a very wide definition of brownfield sites and the questions are meaningless without context, particularly when comparing urban and rural brownfield sites and without considering residual pollution issues, cost of clean up and local demand for facilities and services."
610,"This is all to do with meeting the demand for more housing in this country but why use up our land for housing, brownfield or otherwise when there is so much run down property that could be demolished and that land used for building new houses or re-purposed."
1297,This is confusing! I always thought a brownfield site was one that had been used before for either industrial purposes or for housing (now derelict)! After this survey I am still confused!!!!
1461,"This is very difficult to give a real opinion without knowing where these sites are - outskirts of a town/city, countryside, suburbs e.g a wind farm on the outskirts of a town is very different from the middle of the countryside etc."
490,This land should be used before greenbelt
2079,this land to be used to provide nature with a home to thrive
472,This subject quickly becomes one for specialists. There are many factors to take into account. I’d like to form my views after receiving a consultation paper on a particular site. Stating general preferences as I’ve done above seems rather pointless to me.
1990,"This survey is useless. It is impossible to select an option in a similar position to the one above it. For example if I select the first option on the left, I cannot select the first option on the left in the following question. Poorly designed. Also the questions are too loaded and false assumptions are made. A more clearly defined set of questions and clearly define the characteristics of a brownfield site giving its history. Otherwise a valued answer to any question cannot be made.This is a very poor survey!"
249,This topic is more complex than the questions you ask. There is not enough information about the circumstances of the sites to get a true picture of the situations in reality.
2081,"This was food for thought for me, most interesting!!"
975,Time to look at unoccupied property first
858,To many houses being built we need green spaces
317,To many sites are being ruined with new bad quality new build housing
106,To much building on them
368,Too difficult to read and enter values for
282,"Too frequently in my experience, councils and the like do not employ knowledgeable individuals or groups to perform biodiversity surveys as the people they employ are more likely to come up with an answer that is the one desired by the council or the developer rather than the one required by the public."
971,Too many are turned into housing estates
1159,Too many developers are being allowed to build on green belt land and greenfield sites. Too many new houses are being built on land that floods. I think Government corruption and poor legislation is allowing this to happen. Generous donations to the current Government from housing developers are allowing local peoples view to be ignored and overridden.
210,"Too many houses going up, resulting in less land"
2196,"too many investment building exist and are being built all properties must be used for housing, offices converted too"
1668,Too many natural spaces being turned into housing without thought of wildlife or communities.
37,Too many new housing estates in the UK
1795,Too much being used for housing
1806,"Too much development in this area, let Brownfield sites alone"
1818,Too much development on land that needed to be left alone rather than redevelopment of poor areas
1053,"Too much development, we need to reduce our population"
132,"Too much housing with no added infrastructure in my area. No added shops, GP surgeries, parks, schools, hospitals, roads etc"
1130,Too much is monopolised by wealthy Individuals
475,Too much is used for housing
1333,"Too much land is owned by too few people. Developers don’t use land well, modern housing estates are mostly overpriced pokey houses in twee cul de sacs with no sustainability or walkability. use of brownfield sites is a positive for being land back into use, rubbish leading questions in this survey, you can’t make a judgement of one site or another based on one photo."
634,"Too much land ownership in the UK is secretive. Data on land ownership should be freely available. We should move towards taxing land ownership (along with other wealth) more, and income less."
2158,Too much of our open countryside is being used for housing and industry.
292,Too much talking. Why not have local authority elections have these questions for the electorate as well as voting for councillors?
232,"Too often brownfield sites not explored as to their potential; too much high quality agricultural land still being used for housing and other develpolments, particularly in South East England."
1311,transparency on development is crucial
2056,Treat golf courses as brown field sites
1256,"Try and keep as wildlife, if no sign of wildlife, use it for renewables"
1705,"Turn into housing, schools and youth centres"
927,"Undeveloped and brownfield sites should be used to improve the biodiversity and environmental health of the area. It should not be sold to the highest bidder, or a friend/family member of the cabinet office!"
491,"Undeveloped brownfield sites should as a priority be earmarked for social housing, with affordable housing a secondary concern. Equally as important, undeveloped sites should be managed in order to discourage delinquency."
1829,Undeveloped land in towns and cities can be used to build on.
823,Undeveloped sites or greenfield sites?
945,Undeveloped sites should be kept for wildlife
455,Undeveloped sites should be used for housing where there is a local need for this. But it should be affords me to that local area and available to local people.
1156,"Unfortunately more housing is essential due to overpopulation. If limits on human numbers cannot or (more likely) will not be enforced then some land has to be sacrificed. I would prefer this to be land that does not currently support wildlife to a great degree. However, as we have seen with HS2 sadly human 'wants' are always favoured over wildlife 'needs'."
1054,Unfortunately we need to develop available sites to keep up with demand for housing but no-one wants it in their local area.
2177,"Unused sites are a waste, they should at least be open to the public somewhere where people can walk with dogs, that is providing the site is safe"
731,Urban brownfield sites should be flattened
1172,Use barren land for housing and nature rich land alone.
1809,Use before greenfield sites
677,use brown field sites before greenfield
923,Use brown site before green for housing
1580,"Use brownfield sites for development, not greenbelt."
1683,"Use for affordable housing for people to buy, or renewable resources"
2116,Use for nature to take over or public nature reserve
186,Use of brownfield sites should be prioritised over expansion into the countryside.
95,Use of land should be closely managed
2238,Use should be dependant upon location. Inner city or urban brownfield ites should be prime for housing. This survey totally ignores this important aspect.
1367,Use them
1474,Use them and not green belt
2058,Use them before greenfield
705,Use them first in preference to developing green field sites
543,Use them for houses if no wildlife
1848,Use them for housing
11,Use them to protect wildlife and to encourage renewable energy sources that won't damage the environment
1505,used to reset the economy as part of the covid recovery/green agenda
2197,Using as many practical brownfield sites as possible is a much better option than farmers selling their land or building houses on areas known to flood. Or interfering with the green belt.
749,Very complecates issue. I don't know enough to comment
783,"Very hard to pick the least worse options in this part of the survey, the choices are all pretty dire. would like to have seen planting a woodland or having a lido built or an outdoor school where children could learn about planting seeds and gro.wing their own food"
2129,Very interesting topic indeed
1625,Very interesting topic to explore - many important issues vying for precedence!
7,very useful
642,"We already have too many flats filling up all areas of green and brown sites locally with little consideration to green/brown/wildlife areas for people and nature to enjoy. We should also be doing more to create a thriving local and national green economy, to work in conjunction with nature and local communities to complement living areas and create pleasant, green living areas generally."
1947,We are in desperate need of housing so this would be good but combined with flowers and green space
1025,"We are in grave danger of causing severe issues with respect to biodiversity and climate change, and so supporting wildlife and then development of renewable, zero carbon energy should be the top priorities."
588,We desperately need more housing both rented and owned so young people can get a home of their own at an affordable cost. Development companies should be penalised if they just sit on their land banks.
1957,We desperately need more places for wildlife to thrive and for people to get out in nature.
740,"We do not need more houses built where we concrete over land that can absorb water. We do need more trees and that has not been discussed here, apart from a vague idea of managed nature reserve that could be treeless."
843,We do not seem to be looking after waste ground enough.
2232,We have a lot of brownfield sites that are being ignored by developers who would rather build on the green belt
1385,We have too many empty industrial sites so I would rather we did something for the environment
693,We need houses
774,"We need housing and despite the often pushed myth, we have miles and miles of beautiful open spaces. Using brownfield sites should be push more and more. Care of course should be taken in over burdened areas and we must take care of nature but a balance can be found without every insect/wildlife taking over."
675,We need housing and facilities for the people who will live there
844,We need housing and jobs but also need green belt areas for human enjoyment.
1379,We need housing.
1110,We need housing. We need to make the land available
2112,"We need more biodiversity in the world with more trees to enable carbon capture, we also need space for humans to enjoy the out doors and for wild life (nature) to flourish Solar power in UK not great neither bio fuels as they are also carbon emitters There are plenty of derelict industrial sites that can be repurposed for industry and although we need more houses we also desperately need to reduce population growth which since the 1950's seems to have exploded"
150,We need more green power in ways which affects wild life least e.g. wind and solar farms
2011,We need more green space for people to get out doors
1812,We need more green spaces in our Cities and Towns
153,we need more green spaces in towns - so bring back parks - sports fields for schools etc brownfields on the edges of town for renewable energy - away from schools and houses .
336,We need more houses
653,We need more housing but also accessible low cost nature spots
42,We need more housing so brownfield sites should not be left undeveloped and derelict.
1281,"We need more social housing in the country, where better to put in than places that get used as dumping grounds by the public."
1299,We need more wild spaces for wildlife hopefully this can be done properly some of it can also have either wind and solar sites that also encourage bio diversity.
217,We need natural formations and areas of natural beauty and green energy sources
1748,We need these sites invested in for wildlife and green spaces . But be managed!! No fly tipping or anti social behaviour
79,We need to adapt most of the housing we already have making previously built properties affordable for everyone rather than building more homes that can't be afforded by anyone which then sit there vacant.
158,We need to Balance out wildlife but also Build more affordable housing. especially in the South Hams in Devon.
1892,"We need to be giving more land back to nature, not taking it away. No to housing on brown and green field"
418,"we need to clean up the places that allow for crime such as derelict buildings, and we should be using these sites to produce renewable energy where possible, but where there is a benefit to wildlife, they should be carefully maintained but mostly left alone."
1465,We need to consider housing for those who cannot afford to buy and within this must be sufficient garden space for children to flourish and learn about providing food from garden space.
707,We need to focus on making better use of space and the number of empty homes/offices before looking at undeveloped land. There will be lots of commercial property that will remain empty after the pandemic as people work from home more and office space is reduced. This should be converted to housing to preserve what undisturbed land is left
586,We need to increase the development of these areas
1986,We need to keep as much green land free of housing and building as possible . We are only a small island .
704,"We need to look at impact holistically, rather than just site by site - eg, by allowing a river to curve more, flooding could be reduced 100 miles down stream; if this space is turned into housing, how does that effect the light and access to open space of the existing residents? This isn't NIMBYism, good quality affordable housing is needed. I would also argue that not every last millimetre of land must be put to economic use, see what happens when the development comes from communities, nature and time"
1458,We need to make sure that wasteland or unoccupied buildings are put to use. There is an urgent need for housing and it would be better to have it used for housing (local authority or housing association)
1821,"We need to protect our natural world far more than we currently do. Mankind doesn't own this planet, we share it with all other life forms and vegetation!"
577,We need to strike a good balance between keeping open spaces and developing every bit of spare land going
497,We need to use these for natural uses as far as possiblr
1077,We need to value open spaces for the benefit of everyone.
1882,We really need more nature sites. We are losing our green spaces.
1173,"We should be making better use of brownfield sites and prioritising reuse of land over permitting development of 'virgin' land everywhere. In addition more attention needs to be given to the needs of local communities, for example by favouring starter homes and retirement/downsizer homes instead of excess 'executive' homes, which create imbalance in smaller communities such as the village where I live."
646,We should be pushing everything towards renewable energy
791,We should be using brownfield sites and empty dwellings to provide more council housing and affordable housing before we ruin the countryside by overdevelopment.
1718,"We should do our best to preserve wildlife first,"
2216,"We should make more use of previously developed abandoned sites over greenfield sites. If rich in nature; I would prefer this was left or prioritised to nature, or utilised for something that contributed or minimised the negative impact on nature over housing or industrial use."
2026,"we should not build on Greenfield sites. We should re-develop Brownfield sites. Remanage/ Repurpose old housing/ tower blocks in cities/towns is where we should redevelop/ build houses, cheap terraced housing is (classic style with modern tech ideal for best use of space)"
332,We should plant more trees on undeveloped sites which have few other uses
294,We should strongly look at brownfield sites for other uses BEFORE we start looking at green sites to build housing on. We can't cover the UK with houses it is plain stupid. People live in the country for a reason not for them to extend into towns. Now Covid has let's say depleted some high streets/offices etc these sites should be looked at for housing.
1230,We should use all brownfield sites before any other land is developed
606,We should use more brownfield sites than we ar and save the green field sites which will of course mean undeveloped sites
1204,We should use space we have but should be looking for climate positive change.
454,"We wouldn't need to develop most of these sites if immigration was only on an ""as necessary"" basis."
1240,Well since I currently live in what seems to double up as a tip anything would be an improvement and the rats think so too!
1595,"What happens to brownfield sites and abandoned greenfield sites depends very much on the size and location of the site. In view of the government's targets for housebuilding, I would prefer development to be on brownfield sites than greenfield sites. The pictures that you showed earlier in the questionnaire were all of fairly large areas, the areas that I was considering were all very much smaller, for example the site of an old factory in towns/villages and I still believe that these would be best developed for housing rather than a greenfield site being developed for housing in an adjacent village."
810,Whatever happens to them they should all be managed sites
621,When land is at a premium brownfield sites should be reused for the most appropriate use
1588,when possible use for housing
593,When re-purposing land the character of the land and the area should be considered. Areas rich in wildlife should be last on the list to be re-developed anything that ruins the character of an area should also be considered. An area that is rich in wildlife and contributes to the character of an area should be left as an undeveloped site. Brownfield sites should be prioritised for housing and industrial development.
130,When the older generation dies there will be a surfeit of housing. Many of the homes being built today are so small and shoddy they are the slums of tomorrow.
925,"where housing, particularly affordable housing is needed, this should be the priority."
1877,Where possible public should be able to access land where it is safe to do so. Unsafe or polluted land should be made safe for wildlife and public access
1062,Where possible use the opportunity to develop housing on brown field sites.
2132,Where we live there is a bigger problem of sites being bought for development then abandoned before development is completed. This is a waste of land which should be used for housing and creates dirty and unsafe areas.
1029,"Wherever possible city brownfield sites should be used for housing development, rather than developing new green sites. Empty shops could be redeveloped for housing for example."
1616,Which type of buildings
128,"While housing issues need to be addressed, too much building work spoils the landscape and makes problems for wildlife."
1475,"Whilst the main focus should be maintaining biodiversity, the local community also needs to be considered as often just leaving a site means that it gets used for other things instead of actively managing the site."
1072,Why can’t old derelict houses etc be demolished and new housing put on that site. We need open spaces and more trees
2164,"Why does brownfield sites take soooo long to get planning permission? It’s what puts developers off developing these sites... Sidford, Devon, industrial site.... excess of ten years before planning granted!!!"
600,why is there so many green field sites used before brownfield site its because the developer has to clear a brownfield site before they build and a green field site is easy to clear
193,Wild spaces and wildlife are needed for mental health
2142,Wildlife and access to local school children to learn about global warming and environmental changes could be beneficial to the local communities.
1278,Wildlife come first
2212,Wildlife for all
1663,"Wildlife is the most important factor in terms of building on any site and housing has no interest for me, especially over the habitat of wildlife"
900,Wildlife is the most important thing to protect
140,Wildlife need places to live just as much as people. The future emphasis in the world and certainly in our small country needs to be something drastic to reduce the population because the planet and our small island just cannot support all these people and all these cars
835,Wildlife should be the priority
311,Wind farms and solar farms are an enormous waste of land and energy.
1817,Wind farms are noisy for locals and kill lots of birds which needs addressing
2149,Wind farms should only be built at sea. All new buildings should have solar panels fitted by law.
759,"Wind farms, and solar power are fecking useless, they are hugely INEFFICIENT, they take up huge swathes of land, they kill ENDANGERED, wildlife, and they only go ahead because many MP's have a financial interest in them. Brown sites should be used for social housing for BRITISH people, not scrounging illegal immigrants that our politically correct and gutless politicians let in without any background checks."
31,wish i was more educated on this topic before taking the survey
1276,wish more housing was on brownfield sites
1792,"With 216,000 homes in England empty for over six months and over 600,000 homes currently vacant in England, I think plans to put more land under housing is premature. There are ways to bring these properties back into the housing economy eg. having an open register of empty homes so that people can contact the owners, like they do in some US states."
1670,With the housing shortage we should develop land to aid that that doesn’t impact wildlife by also creating A nature reserve for local residents to be able to use
1262,without bees etc we would lose a lot of food we rely on
949,"Without more information about previous use of the land it was very difficult if not impossible to answer these questions, especially those based on photos alone."
388,Would be good to see them used to enhance the environment not detract further
509,would be nice to see them used for something that gives back to the community in the form of an area for people to enjoy or to help the planet in some way.
1144,Would be very concerned about building houses everywhere. There needs to be a balance between affordable housing and caring for the environment which to me is a priority
1529,Would rather a derelict site being used whether it’s housing or nature
915,Yes I was limited to my responses as the last 4 or 5 questions did not allow for a measured response by no letting me rank my preferences. It stopped me from listing as I wanted by giving limited response options.
1538,YOU NEEDTO KEEP THE GREEN SPACES FOR YOUR MENTEL HEALTH
1935,"Your questions are of a far to general nature, Brownfield sites can have either little in the way of problems, or huge amount of problems surrounding the site, the photos you show can look very innocent, turn round and it's a Nuclear power station!!"
